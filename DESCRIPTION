Description: Allows for spatially-explicit, simulation-based power analysis of 
  wildlife occupancy monitoring programs and their ability to detect trends in a
  population's abundance. These power analyses provide a range of parameter  
  settings that can be adjusted to evaluate a variety of monitoring efforts.  
  This package is built upon the previous 'rSPACE' package.
